# Categorical-Final-Project

All code is inside the src folder in FinalProj.jl

Running the code should be sufficient to start up the file as the project and manifest files are included. If issues arise, try downloading the packages manually with "]" and the package names like so:

add Pkg1, Pkg2,...
